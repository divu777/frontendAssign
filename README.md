# Book Search and Bookshelf Application

This is a React application that allows users to search for books and add them to a personal bookshelf. The app uses the Open Library API to fetch book data and local storage to save the user's bookshelf.

## Features

- **Book Search:** Users can search for books by entering a query in the search input. The results are fetched from the Open Library API.
- **Bookshelf:** Users can add books to their personal bookshelf. The bookshelf data is stored in the browser's local storage, so it persists between sessions.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is styled using Tailwind CSS and is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
